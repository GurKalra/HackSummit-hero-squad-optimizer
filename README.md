# 🛡️ Hero Squad Optimizer

Welcome to the **Hero Squad Optimizer**, a web application designed to help Dungeons & Dragons players strategically plan their party composition and optimize their actions for various in-game encounters.  

This tool leverages a **dual machine learning architecture** to provide both predictive success rates and creative, turn-by-turn strategic advice.

## ✨ Features

- 🧙‍♂️ **Dynamic Party Creation**: Create and manage a party of up to four characters, customizing their names, classes, and stats.  
- 📊 **Stat Allocation System**: Distribute a pool of 80 points across six core stats (Strength, Agility, Mana, etc.) for each character.  
- 🐉 **Encounter Selection**: Choose from a variety of pre-defined adventures, each with a unique difficulty and theme.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Get a comprehensive strategic breakdown for your party against the chosen encounter.  
- 📈 **Predictive Success Chance**: View a percentage-based prediction of your party's likelihood of success, powered by a custom-trained neural network.  
- ✍️ **Generative Action Recommendations**: Receive creative, class-specific action recommendations for the current character’s turn, generated by the Google Gemini model.

## 🧠 How It Works: The Dual ML Architecture

The app’s core is a unique **dual-model backend** that combines prediction and creativity. Both are handled inside a single Next.js API route (`/api/analyze`).

### 1. Predictive Analysis (TensorFlow.js)
- **Purpose**: Answers *“Numerically, what is our chance of success?”*  
- **Technology**: Sequential neural network with TensorFlow.js.  
- **Training**: Offline training with `scripts/train-model.ts` using a dataset (`data/training_dataset.json`) of historical party outcomes.  
- **Process**: Party data is encoded into a numerical vector → fed into the pre-trained model → outputs an instant prediction.

### 2. Generative Strategy (Google Gemini)
- **Purpose**: Answers *“Creatively, what should we do right now?”*  
- **Technology**: Google Gemini Large Language Model (LLM).  
- **Process**: Backend builds a detailed text prompt (class, stats, encounter details) → Gemini API returns strategic and thematic actions.  

Together, **TensorFlow.js provides the “what”**, while **Gemini provides the “how.”**
